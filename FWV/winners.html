				<p>I would like to thank my father. This spoken word is for him, taken from a poem I wrote for him in 2012. Yet, I have not given nor read this poem to him... It's funny that I'd share it with the world before I would him. This man taught me how to love and respect the people around me... that's something that's life.</p>

				<p>I wish I could thank a first-grade teacher, somewhere in Michigan. Detroit? Marquette? I don't know her name, never will, but I thank her often. I volunteer at my state's sole female prison, the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan, record incarcerated mothers and grandmothers reading bedtime stories to the children and grandchildren they haven't seen for months, sometimes years. Our organization, Children's Literacy Network, then mails the books and recordings to the children. It's a popular program with a waitlist almost one year long.</p>
				<p>Several weeks ago, one of the moms we recorded earlier this year stopped by to thank us, again. The women thank us repeatedly for the work &mdash; the guards, too. This mother told us that her son had brought his recording to school. "This is my mom," he told his teacher, holding up the CD, along with his book. "This is my mom." His mother has been in prison for years so his friends haven't met her, nor have any of his teachers.</p>
				<p>"Well," this first grade teacher said, "let's meet your mom." She played the CD for his entire class, twice.</p> 
				<p>So thank you, Michigan first-grade teacher, whoever you are, wherever you live. I don't know your teaching style or any of the data the state will use to evaluate your performance, but I do know your generosity and respect of that boy and his mother helped make him feel proud and a roomful of prisoners, along with the volunteers, cry for joy.</p>

				<p>I would like to thank my sons for teaching me among other important things, respect: for them, for myself and for others. It is because of my 5 sons, that I want to be a better person, a better mom and a better human being.</p>
				<p>As a mom of five boys, ages 12-17, life has been anything but easy. Having gone through a separation, divorce, losing them for over a year, being raped, and the tumultuous teenage years has not made it any easier. But throughout the ups and downs that life has to offer, our love for each other, has given me strength. Had it not been for them, I might not have stood up for myself and made sure my rapist was convicted. I might not have respected myself enough to chose a new loving and respectful spouse. They taught me to respect myself.</p>
				 <p>I often wondered why God didn't give me girls, but now I know it was to make sure that I gave the world 5 responsible, loving and respectful young men. Everyday, I strive to teach them to not only respect themselves and others, but especially every female they encounter ; to know that 'no means no!', that a woman is just as powerful and capable as a man, and most importantly, that every woman they encounter, should be treated with the same love and respect as they would want me to be treated with. With God's help, they will be not only good husbands and fathers, but respectful human beings. And my job on earth, will be done. Thank you Haiden, Rosendo, Cristian, Jason, and Kevin for teaching me what unconditional love is for forgiving my parental mistakes, for knowing your are my heart and showing me what true respect it. I love you.</p>

				<p>I would like to thank Safe Passage, Inc. for teaching me the meaning of respect. Safe Passage is a domestic violence agency in Batesville, Indiana that has served over 4,000 victims of domestic violence since its opening 16 years ago. As an employee of the organization, I have observed how many clients have learned to respect through the agency's  intervention and prevention services. After interviewing various individuals who have been through violent situations, I have concluded that in order to respect anyone else, one must respect him or herself. <!-- Please see the included video to see a creative representation of how Safe Passage has taught previous and current clients and employees the meaning of respect. --></p>

				<p>My father taught me the importance and value of respect.  As a child raised on a farm, I earned and gave respect based upon hard work,  perseverance and how you treated others.  Respect was gained from what you did and how you acted, not who you were.  My dad taught me to respect myself, my gender and my strengths and in turn, others would too.  Now, as a professor teaching domestic violence advocacy, my male and female students all learn to respect the power and value of each other's voices and to see the critical importance of a collective effort to combat dating violence.  Respect is the foundation of this movement to improve each other's lives.</p>

If you truly respected yourself, we learned, then honor our teachers, parents and community by living up to our limitless potential.

				<p>I would like to thank my mother for teaching me how to respect others. As a child, whenever I would make a rude or critical comment about an individual or group, she would quickly correct me and remind me the importance of loving others and being kind even if you don't agree. I never heard her say any negative comments or jokes about other races and religions. Not to say she never had any, but as a good parent she didn't say them around me or my brothers. She was a single parent and worked 80 hours a week to support us. She took responsibility and put herself last in order to supply our needs and even our wants.  She demonstrated to me that loving others is the best way to show respect and working is the best way to have self respect.</p>

				<p>I used to get confused when I was in Kindergarten, because all the other students in my class would use a different colored crayon from mine when drawing self-portraits.  I asked my grandmother why this was.  Her response was simple: the world is made of people who look different.  There are people who use a light crayon to draw a self-portrait, there are people who use a darker crayon, like you and there are a million other colors in between.  It's important that we respect all the different colored crayons that people use, because those colors make us special.  But you always have to remember that regardless of what color you use for your self-portrait, we still all have red blood in our veins.  And that's the only color that really matters.</p>
				<p>My grandmother's words have stuck with me since then.  Growing up, I have seen the negative effects of bullying and violence in schools, and at the root of the issue is always the fact that one person is different from another.  Because of my grandmother, I respect, appreciate, accept and even celebrate the differences between the people around me.  Without these differences, we would not be able to progress and learn together as a society.  However, I never become too preoccupied in physical differences, because I know that underneath them flows the same red blood, and we deserve respect just for that.</p>

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001043240280" rel="external" target="_blank">Christian Hallmark</a>: Respect your elders. Honestly, out of the numerous expressions that life has elicited throughout contemporary society this has proven to be the most accurate.  Only your elders have experienced the true nature of life, the very morale life is built upon.  Without knowledge of past experiences, we become incompetent with the nastiest life has to offer, not the difficult Calculus exam, or the Baseball team try-out, no, the nastiest life has the offer is that unexpected phone call we receive on a Tuesday night.  my siblings, parents, grandparents, and friends have all taught altering ranges of character through respect, from my parents divorce to the loss of my grandmother to cancer. Still, no previous figure compared to the amount of insight I confronted when I entered Cathedral High- located in El Paso, Texas, and on the border of Ciudad, Juarez, globally deemed one of the most treacherous regions in all of modern civilization.  Here, on the border we come into contact with individuals who have lost parents to gruesome murders, witnessed kidnapping of their siblings, have their very capacity as individuals stolen.  In a year at Cathedral I would have come to witness peers who challenged all these issues, leaving the hanging thought of how much more my Victimology teacher, Chief Justice Barajas, has seen in his numerous years there.  He himself has lost family to crime making his advice on absolutely any matter regarded as nothing less than the absolute truth.  I believe him, for I know he has gone through more than anyone I have or will ever meet in my lifetime.  I've finally realized that respect is not just preparing and acknowledging what life is, but also what it has in store for us, and I want to be there to help every step of the way.

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=755433408" rel="external" target="_blank">Miosoti Waller</a>: I would like to thank my Mother. She raised me and my siblings all on her own. She made sure to always tell us that if you don't respect yourself first then you can never expect others to respect you. She taught us to respect those around us and to treat everyone as you would like to be treated. My mother was a victim of domestic violence from my father but she never let that define who she was. She was a strong woman who raised me and my brother and sister to be good people and treat everyone well.

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001656426717" rel="external" target="_blank">Joshua Palacios</a>: Respect is an abstract concept, one of those which is hard to really grasp until the moment it is bestowed on you. Usually, it is one major event or person in your life which gives you this gift of respect. In my case it was my mother, but not in the way most kids learn respect through their parents. I learned it through the injury my mother sustained, and has struggled with every single day since then. From that day onward I began to look at the world differently. That day I was introduced to real pain, not every day migraine or stomach pain, but pain that hopefully we will never have to know on such a personal level. Through that pain, I came to know suffering, deep suffering which so often comes along with strong pains such as this. As time passed this pain and suffering taught me a great number of things, in hindsight it might have taught me the greatest, possibly most important thing I've ever learned. I learned the gift of appreciation, and through this the whole world changed for me. I began to see every moment, no matter what it as a gift. I began to appreciate my friends, family, elders, all the people who had gone through difficult times like my mom, the whole world was in a new light for me. And now seeing everything as a gift I began to treat it accordingly, with the honor and respect which everyone and everything deserves. The way I learnt respect might not have been the most conventional way, but I wouldn't want it any other way, because now it is a part of me that I will never lose and that will forever remind me of the impact my mother has had on me.

<div class="stories_answer">
<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005573562337" rel="external" target="_blank">Linda Hamilton</a>: My grandparents would always quote Conficius to me as a child, "Respect yourself and others will respect you."  Most of childhood was spent with them as my father passed away when i was two-years-old and my mother was a surgical nurse.   My grandmother would compare respect to a seed as she gardened every summer. She stated, "behavior is like a seed: it is a process that becomes stronger with fertilization."  We lived in a culturally diverse area of Chicago.  One day a man was sitting on the street asking for money.  Instead of giving him money, she made him two sandwiches. She taught me i had to treat others as i would expect to be treated regardless of the color of my skin, the amount of money i made, or if were disabled.  My Grandfather owned a pharmacy and would let me follow him to meet the customers.  He always embedded in my head to say please and thank you, but i just could not wait to watch him make the paste for the next prescription.  At noon, he would say it was time for our Consitutional meaning that we had the right to take a lunch.  During Lunch he would talk about how all people have the same basic needs and the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution to protect our behavior in society.  At 3, this was over my head.  If i won this contest, I would like the money to go to this Organization to establish a Futures Against Violence Week in every school in this country and abroad.  Respect transcends neighborhoods and the borders wwithin we live separated only by water, but yet all people have the RIGHT AND NEED TO RESPECT. Thank you.

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003227605017" rel="external" target="_blank">Tonya Munque</a>: I would like to thank my best friend for teaching me how to respect others as well as myself. I was so ashamed of who I was due to being molested as a child but Erica helped me see that I was a beautiful soul who deserved happiness. I had so much hatred for my attacker that it really affected my relationships with family, friends and any potential partner. At the end of the day, I had to learn to forgive him and love the woman staring back at me in the mirror. I got counseling, joined online communities filled with supportive women and I slowly started to become the woman that I am today. Erica was there through the depression, anxiety and anger management classes. I don't know where I would be without her help and I make sure to thank her as often as I can. She has my utmost respect for teaching me the power of forgiveness and acceptance.

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006653224682" rel="external" target="_blank">Duron Lemar</a>:   I am a student at Lula Washington Dance Theatre, and for the past two years that I have been dancing there, I have learned so much about me and how to respect my friends, family and myself. Lula and her staff are great mentors to all the students who walk through the doors. When I learned about this competition I knew that this was something I wanted to do for my mentor and her organization. So far Lula has taught me about how my posture can exude confidence and happiness. I grew up with both of my parents in prison for a long time I went through life unhappy most of the time, but since being a student here at LWDT, I feel as if though it has transformed my life. I have seen how this organization has help prevent young children in the community from joining gangs, and bullying or getting bullied. I feel as if though I was meant to be involved with this group of people who have become a second family to me. I hope that my video will illustrate my experience at Lula Washington Dance Theatre.

<div class="stories_answer">
<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=592879785" rel="external" target="_blank">Cari Clark</a>: I would like to thank Monica Brase, Principal of Burns Latino Studies Academy, for teaching me about respect. She is my friend and role model for many things, but especially in the way she models respect for oneself, respect for others, and respect for place.  She has brought about enormous change through her respect for kids. As a gifted teacher, I have seen her change the course of kids' lives who had been written off by others as delinquents. Kids who would never have considered college are now university bound honors' students. Kids who have learned to use violence to achieve an aim, are now change agents in their communities.  The school has gone from 9th in the state for student arrests to a safe and positive learning environment.  The impact of her leadership is felt by her students, their parents, and the community. I am not alone in the way I feel. Below are words from a letter written by 3 students (Victoria, Yamilet, and Vantaja) and attached is a video from one of her colleagues, Elizabeth Giannetta. 

"When Dr. Brase came her, she had high expectations for us. She wanted to change this school and make it better for us kids. Dr. Brase had taught us to respect our self, respect others, and respect the environment. She hired good teaches that won't just sit around and not teach us stuff. Dr. Brase didn't only change the school, she changed what people thought of this school. When people fought here, cops were being called and the cops had a nick name for us, Little Alcatraz, just like the people out in our community. Now, people look at us different. Cops are not called a lot, and we are now the best students Dr. Brase made us."

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006793141539" rel="external" target="_blank">MsShannon HealthEducator</a>: The Teen Advisory Council (TAC) at Arthur Hill High School got together and discussed what respect meant to them. They talked about how they could respect themselves, as well as their peers. . They disucssed bullying and the negaitve effects it can have on an individual. They decided that not only did they want to thank those people in their lives who taught them respect, but they wanted a visual to show how to respect someone who others may not. The students shown in the video are just a representation of the 20+ TAC members who contributed to this discussion. The group also plans to created a "Respect Pledge" that they will share with their school and ask others to adopt. This group is very passionate about the importance of showing respect in all circumstances. The Respect Challege was a great opportunity for them to share real life stories/experiences and allow them a safe space to discuss how change can happen, and how they can be agents of change!

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=733835030" rel="external" target="_blank">Zim Thompson</a>: I would like to thank my trilogy: grandmother, mother and god-mother/school teacher.  Thanking my family is a given but infinite thanks to the woman who taught me everything from Kindergarten to Seventh grade. My teacher Mrs. Kelly. She taught me to repect myself, my family, education and most importantly respect the bible.  She taught me that discipline in any form is a positive reinforcement for respect.  She not only taught but lived by the code of respect.  Respect and Love go hand in hand.  Even 35 years later I remember and utilize everything she has taught me and it all reflects back to the one reoccuring theme.  Respect.  In respecting education I have excelled in all that I do, In respecting myself I am able to give to others the way she gave to me.  In respect for my family I was able to ride the wave of life when my grandmother developed alzheimers.  Repecting both she and the disease until the last day.  And most importantly in learning to respect the bible by Mrs. Kelly, I am able to live every day knowing that I can do all things through Christ who strenthens me.  I respect life and all that it brings.

She has shown me how important it is to respect someone because if you do, one day they will be there for you and respect you back.  Respect is something very important in everyones life and it is something everyone deserves.  One little action of respect could make a big difference in someones life.

<a href="//www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1304407251" rel="external" target="_blank">Albert Fernandez</a>: With such an immoral world nowadays, the principle of respect is one of the key values maintaining society in balance. To obtain this value, we all need a lesson. My lesson in particular is owned to a play that I watched not too long ago titled, "12 Angry Men."  In this play, the fate of a man accused of murder depended on the unanimous decisions of the jury. At first, eleven jury men declare the man guilty within five minutes and were ready to sentence him to death. One of them however, decided to consider the facts again to at least show interest for his life. As actual discussion was open on the case, reasonable doubts arose resulting in the unanimous vote of innocence for the "criminal". Respect does not comes from proving a "criminal" to be innocent, but the example of the jury man who wanted to go deeper into the case is what taught me respect. It was these 12 actors representing the justice of a system such as the one in the U.S that showed me respect. The willingness to consider the life of a criminal to me showed something so humane that I immediately accepted it. These men showed respect in the darkest of situations, and such was their respect and compassion that I felt changed by this play to show respect in everyday life. To these 12 men and especially to the man who opened the discussion, dignity for this man was present at all times and the respect for his life was simply beyond explanation in my eyes. I walked out of the theatre thinking "if there is respect for those who seem not to deserve it, then why should I be disrespectful?" Until this day, I have not yet found an answer.
